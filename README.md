# PARD Web HW1 Introducing Myself
## Topic
The first assignment is to create a web page that contains information that can introduce myself.
Each pages include:
- Who I am
- My Favorite Things
- My Goals for This Semester
- My Motto
- SNS

## Skills
I tried to practice and have a detailed revision of 'markup language' including HTML, CSS, Js.
I found myself getting more and more interested in learning new skills such as importing better font styles or icons from outer libraries and decorating images with different types of border as the project progresses.

## IDE
Visual Studio Code
